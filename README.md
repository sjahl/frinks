About 
=====

A simple database app for storing links.

I like Pinboard. I also like self-hosted solutions. Mainly a project to learn the Sinatra basics.

More to come. Tagging maybe? Starring/Favoriting?

Moved to a twitter-bootstrap based solution (I'm too lazy to write styles)

Installation
============

Updated to use bundler. First do a:

`gem install bundler`

Then do a:

`bundle install --path vendor/gems`

Then run it:
`ruby app.rb`
